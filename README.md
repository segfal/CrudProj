# Fullstack CRUD Project: Student-Campus Directory

The final project can be accessed here: https://64a852a648013d123d6d4784--aesthetic-hotteok-d489a7.netlify.app/

Goal of this Project: Using Node, Express, React, Redux, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize, build a RESTful full-stack web application to manage students and campuses. This will cover all of the CRUD operations such as Creation, Reading, Updating, and Deletion. This will encompass models, querying a database with an ORM, designing routes/endpoints and handler functions to process user requests and generate responses, writing out React Components, managing the state of the application with React-Redux, and much more. This will also involve having two individual repositories/applications (a separate server and a separate client), which encourages separation of concerns and modularity. 

This website allows for the storing of student and campus information along with their associations with eachother as a fullstack web application.
